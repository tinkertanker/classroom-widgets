# Poll Widget Race Condition Fix Summary

## Problem
The Poll widget was experiencing a race condition where:
1. Play/pause button required multiple clicks (usually 3) to work
2. State would flicker between active and paused
3. Two separate `PollProvider` instances were managing the same widget state

## Root Cause
The `NetworkedWidgetWrapperV2` component creates two separate React component trees:
- One for the header (with play/pause button)
- One for the content area

Each tree had its own `PollProvider` instance, leading to:
- Duplicate socket event handlers
- State synchronization issues
- Conflicting state updates

## Solution Implemented
Created a single `PollSocketManager` component that:
1. Wraps the entire `NetworkedWidgetWrapperV2`
2. Manages all socket connections and events in one place
3. Provides state through `SharedPollContext`
4. Ensures only one socket connection per widget

### Key Changes:
1. **Removed `PollProvider`** - All functionality moved to `PollSocketManager`
2. **Updated `usePollContext`** - Now uses `SharedPollContext` and returns the expected interface
3. **Fixed `PollSettings`** - Updated to use correct prop names (`onClose` instead of `onUpdate`)
4. **Centralized socket management** - All socket events handled in one place

### Architecture:
```
Poll (main component)
  └── PollSocketManager (manages all socket logic)
      └── NetworkedWidgetWrapperV2
          ├── Header
          │   └── PollHeaderControls (uses SharedPollContext)
          └── Content
              └── PollContent (uses SharedPollContext)
```

## Benefits
1. Single source of truth for widget state
2. No duplicate event processing
3. Consistent state across all UI components
4. Play/pause works with single clicks
5. No state flickering

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Start the app: `npm start`
2. Start the server: `cd server && npm start`
3. Add a Poll widget
4. Click the gear icon to set up a poll question
5. Click play button - should start with one click
6. Click pause button - should pause with one click
7. No flickering or multiple clicks needed
