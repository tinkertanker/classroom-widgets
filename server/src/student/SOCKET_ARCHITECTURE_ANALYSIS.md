# Socket Architecture Analysis: Single vs Multiple Connections

## Current Architecture (Multiple Sockets)

### How it works
- Each session gets its own socket connection (line 179: `const newSocket = getSocket()`)
- Currently using factory pattern that creates new socket instances
- Socket stored in `socketRefs` Map with unique sessionId

### Benefits
1. **Isolation**: Each session is completely isolated
2. **Simple event handling**: No need to filter events by session
3. **Clean disconnect**: When leaving session, just close that socket
4. **No event collision**: Different sessions can't interfere

### Drawbacks
1. **Resource usage**: Multiple TCP connections
2. **Connection overhead**: Each socket needs handshake
3. **Complexity in socket management**: Need to track multiple sockets
4. **Potential scaling issues**: More connections = more server resources

## Proposed Architecture (Single Socket)

### How it would work
```typescript
// Single socket instance
const socket = io();

// All events include session context
socket.emit('session:join', { sessionCode, studentName });
socket.emit('poll:vote', { sessionCode, widgetId, option });

// Event handlers filter by session
socket.on('poll:update', (data) => {
  if (data.sessionCode === currentSessionCode) {
    // Handle update
  }
});
```

### Benefits
1. **Resource efficiency**: One TCP connection total
2. **Faster session switching**: No connection setup
3. **Simpler socket lifecycle**: Connect once, use everywhere
4. **Better for mobile**: Less battery/bandwidth usage
5. **Easier reconnection**: One socket to manage

### Drawbacks
1. **Event filtering complexity**: Must filter all events by session
2. **Risk of event leakage**: Bugs could expose wrong session data
3. **Harder debugging**: All events mixed in one stream
4. **Session cleanup**: Must carefully unsubscribe from events
5. **Server-side changes**: Backend must handle session routing

## Risk Assessment

### Single Socket Risks
1. **High Risk**: Event leakage between sessions
   - Mitigation: Strict event filtering, session validation
2. **Medium Risk**: Complex state management
   - Mitigation: Use session context in all events
3. **Medium Risk**: Breaking existing functionality
   - Mitigation: Incremental migration, thorough testing
4. **Low Risk**: Performance degradation
   - Mitigation: Event namespacing, efficient filtering

### Implementation Complexity
- **Frontend**: Medium-High (need to refactor all socket events)
- **Backend**: Medium (need session-aware event routing)
- **Testing**: High (need to verify no session leakage)

## Performance Analysis

### Multiple Sockets (Current)
- Initial connection: ~100-200ms per socket
- Memory: ~10-50KB per socket
- CPU: Minimal per socket
- Network: Separate TCP connection overhead

### Single Socket (Proposed)
- Initial connection: ~100-200ms once
- Memory: ~10-50KB total + event handler overhead
- CPU: Slightly higher (event filtering)
- Network: More efficient (multiplexed)

## Recommendation

**Stay with Multiple Sockets for now**

### Reasoning
1. **Working system**: Current architecture works well
2. **Low user count**: Students typically join 1 session
3. **Isolation benefits**: Security and simplicity
4. **Implementation risk**: High risk for marginal benefit
5. **Future option**: Can migrate later if needed

### When to Consider Single Socket
- Students joining multiple sessions simultaneously
- Performance issues with many connections
- Server resource constraints
- Mobile app with battery concerns

## Migration Strategy (If Needed Later)

### Phase 1: Prepare Infrastructure
1. Add session context to all events
2. Create session-aware event handlers
3. Build event filtering utilities

### Phase 2: Parallel Implementation
1. Create single socket mode flag
2. Implement dual-mode support
3. Test extensively in single socket mode

### Phase 3: Gradual Migration
1. Enable for subset of users
2. Monitor for issues
3. Full rollout if successful

### Phase 4: Cleanup
1. Remove multi-socket code
2. Optimize single socket implementation
3. Update documentation

## Conclusion

While single socket architecture offers some benefits, the current multiple socket approach provides better isolation, simpler code, and lower risk. The marginal performance gains don't justify the implementation complexity and risks at this time.

Recommend keeping current architecture and revisiting only if:
- Performance issues arise
- Usage patterns change (multi-session)
- Mobile app requirements emerge
