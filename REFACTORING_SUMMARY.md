# Networked Widget Refactoring Summary

## What We've Created

### 1. **useNetworkedWidgetSession Hook** (`/src/hooks/useNetworkedWidgetSession.ts`)
A centralized hook that handles:
- Room active state management
- Common socket event listeners (roomCreated, roomClosed)
- Widget cleanup logic
- Start/stop room functionality
- Error handling
- State persistence

### 2. **NetworkedWidgetWrapper Component** (`/src/components/shared/NetworkedWidgetWrapper.tsx`)
A wrapper component that provides:
- Standard empty state with NetworkedWidgetEmpty
- Standard active state with NetworkedWidgetHeader
- Automatic session management
- Consistent UI structure
- Props for customization

### 3. **Utility Functions** (`/src/utils/networkedWidgetUtils.ts`)
Helper functions for:
- Generating standard event names
- Socket response handling
- Creating initial widget state
- Common type definitions

## Benefits of This Refactoring

### 1. **Reduced Code Duplication**
- Widget cleanup logic: ~15 lines → handled by hook
- Room lifecycle events: ~20 lines → handled by hook
- Empty/active state logic: ~30 lines → handled by wrapper
- Total reduction: ~65 lines per widget

### 2. **Consistency**
- All widgets follow the same patterns
- Event naming is standardized
- Error handling is uniform
- UI structure is consistent

### 3. **Maintainability**
- Changes to common functionality only need to be made in one place
- Adding new networked widgets is much simpler
- Testing is easier with isolated components

### 4. **Developer Experience**
- Clear patterns to follow
- Less boilerplate code
- Better type safety
- Easier to understand

## How to Use These Utilities

### Example: Creating a New Networked Widget

```typescript
import { NetworkedWidgetWrapper } from '../shared/NetworkedWidgetWrapper';
import { createWidgetEventNames } from '../../utils/networkedWidgetUtils';
import { FaIcon } from 'react-icons/fa6';

const MyWidget = ({ widgetId, savedState, onStateChange }) => {
  const [myData, setMyData] = useState([]);
  const eventNames = createWidgetEventNames('myWidget');

  return (
    <NetworkedWidgetWrapper
      widgetId={widgetId}
      savedState={savedState}
      onStateChange={onStateChange}
      roomType="myWidget"
      title="My Widget"
      description="Description of my widget"
      icon={FaIcon}
      headerChildren={/* Custom header buttons */}
    >
      {({ session, isRoomActive }) => (
        /* Your widget content here */
      )}
    </NetworkedWidgetWrapper>
  );
};
```

## Remaining Refactoring Opportunities

### 1. **Server-Side Base Classes**
Create base Room classes on the server to handle:
- Participant management
- Activity tracking
- Common event handling
- State persistence

### 2. **Student App Patterns**
Extract common patterns from student activity components:
- State request on mount
- Activity state syncing
- Submission handling
- UI patterns

### 3. **Event Standardization**
Complete the migration to standardized event names:
- Use the createWidgetEventNames utility
- Update server handlers to match
- Document the event flow

### 4. **Type Safety**
Create shared types for:
- Event payloads
- Room states
- Student submissions
- Server responses

### 5. **Testing Utilities**
Create test helpers for:
- Mocking socket connections
- Testing widget lifecycle
- Simulating student interactions

## Migration Guide

To migrate existing widgets to use these utilities:

1. Replace useSessionContext with useNetworkedWidgetSession
2. Wrap component content with NetworkedWidgetWrapper
3. Move socket listeners into the render prop function
4. Use createWidgetEventNames for event naming
5. Remove duplicate state management code
6. Test thoroughly

## Impact

This refactoring reduces each networked widget by approximately 65-80 lines of code while improving consistency, maintainability, and developer experience. The patterns are now clear and easy to follow for future development.
